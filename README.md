### üí° Motivation

Improper waste segregation leads to increased landfill usage, pollution, and inefficient recycling. Automating garbage classification through machine learning can significantly improve environmental sustainability by enabling faster, more accurate sorting of waste materials. This project aims to **build an intelligent system that categorizes garbage using image-based 

### üß† Machine Learning Approach

We utilize **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**‚Äîa powerful deep learning technique particularly effective for image recognition tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled garbage images, each belonging to categories such as:
- **Organic** (food waste, garden clippings)
- **Recyclable** (paper, plastic bottles, aluminum cans)
- **Hazardous** (batteries, e-waste, chemicals)
- **Others** (non-recyclable materials)

The model goes through several training stages:
1. **Data preprocessing:** Image resizing, augmentation, and normalization.
2. **Model training:** CNN architecture with multiple layers (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense).
3. **Validation & tuning:** Accuracy and loss metrics guide optimization.
4. **Deployment:** The trained model is integrated into a web or mobile platform for real-time inference.

### üåç Real-World Applications

- **Smart Waste Bins**: Automatically sort waste as it's discarded.
- **Mobile Apps**: Assist users in identifying waste type before disposal.
- **Recycling Facilities**: Improve speed and accuracy of sorting systems.

This model has the potential to support **smart cities** and promote eco-conscious behavior through technology.
